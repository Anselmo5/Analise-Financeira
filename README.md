# Analise Fianceira
  Our financial analysis project aims at data processing and data analysis, so thinking about how we could make a project that covered the data analysis part and also be visually pleasing to users, therefore we used the idea of ​​building a web system that involved graphics for data analysis and good interaction with the user.

# Ferramentas Usadas
  In the construction of the project we used React for web development. 
  
  We used React router dom for user navigation. 
  
  We used My sql to build the database

# Menção
I can't help but mention two repositories that helped me a lot in creating this project: the repository of AlexCGDesign and Zakaria-29-dev.
The repository of these two people helped me implement the idea I had for this project, making great use of the user experience concept.
